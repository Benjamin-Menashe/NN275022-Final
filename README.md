Abstract
This paper attempts to predict the eye movement behavior of readers from linguistic features, such as word length and frequency. Using the Provo corpus and feature engineering, we trained LSTM neural network models to predict whether the reader will fixate on or skip each word in the text. We reached an accuracy score of 76.93%, which is almost similar to previous approaches. We additionally trained an extended LSTM model to predict the gaze duration for each word and reached 31.93% variance explained.
